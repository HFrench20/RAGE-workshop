# Rabies virus genomic epidemiology (RAGE) workshop

*Monday 26th - Friday 30th June 2023, University of Glasgow, UK*

---

The RAGE workshop is a hands-on training course on nanopore-based genome sequencing to support enhanced canine rabies virus surveillance in a local context.  

Over 5-days, based on the banks of Loch Lomand at the University's scenic [Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environment](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/scene/), participants will undergo introductory training in  a sample-to-sequence-to-interpretation workflow, including nanopore library preparation and basic data analysis.
