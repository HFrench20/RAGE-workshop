## Pre-workshop preparation
Here is some recommended reading (not mandatory!):  
* [Brief intro to  command line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)  
* [Paper: Rapid in-country rabies virus sequencing](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-3/v2)  
* [Paper: Multiplex PCR method for virus sequencing](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.066)

## Things to bring
Not much is required so pack light. Weather in Glasgow is **variable** so be prepared for warm weather (for us that is anything >20oC!) and rain showers.  
* Laptop  
* For your stay at SCENE: bath/hand towels, toiletries, hairdryers and anything else they you may need (it is not a hotel!).  Also please bring with you slippers or indoor footwear for inside building. They provide bed Linen, hand soap and loo roll.

## Travel

#### Flights:
Our university travel provider, Selective, booked your flights and you have received a pdf ticket with your flight details via email. Ensure you check in online using the provided airline reference number. If you have problems with boarding contact Selective asap (contact details on ticket).

#### Arrival in Glasgow: 
Your flight will arrive at [Glasgow International Airport](https://www.glasgowairport.com/). The easiest way to get to your hotel (Motel One, see below) is to get the [Glasgow Airport Express Service 500 bus](https://www.glasgowairport.com/to-and-from/bus/) from stance 1 (follow link for info on tickets), getting off at Waterloo Lane stop [google map](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Glasgow+Airport,+Glasgow,+Paisley/Motel+One,+78-82+Oswald+St,+Glasgow+G1+4PL/@55.8670328,-4.3918523,12.57z/am=t/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x48884eb90111e0dd:0x24a888b519aa330b!2m2!1d-4.4350529!2d55.8690744!1m5!1m1!1s0x4888469c3b4faced:0xbbdada611fdf447!2m2!1d-4.2595396!2d55.8583003!3e3?entry=ttu).  Failing that you can get a taxi from the taxi rank.

## Accommodation & meals

During the workshop (26-30th) you will stay on location at a university field station, SCENE (outside of Glasgow), in single or multiple occupancy rooms (some of you will be sharing). Either side of the workshop (25th June & 1st July) we will provide hotel accommodation in Glasgow city. Due to high demand during the summer months (and an Arctic Monkeys gig!) we have had to split your stay into 2 hotels, therefore the itinerary is a bit complicated: 

#### 25-26th June: [Motel One Glasgow](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/glasgow/hotel-glasgow/) 
Address: [78-82 Oswald St, Glasgow G1 4PL](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Motel+One/@55.859211,-4.2853997,17z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x4888469c3b4faced:0xbbdada611fdf447!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d55.8583001!4d-4.2595688!16s%2Fg%2F11f4ppgx9m?entry=ttu)  
* No meals provided  
When you arrive in Glasgow, travel from the airport to this hotel! Hotel in the city centre, great access to public transport (right next to Glasgow Central train station!)  

#### 26-30th June: [SCENE](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/scene/)  
* Breakfast, lunch & dinner provided (tea/coffee self-serve)   
University field station beside Loch Lomond. A beautiful location!  

#### 1-2nd July: [Hotel Campanile Glasgow SECC](https://glasgow.campanile.com/en-us/)  
Address: [10 Tunnel St, Glasgow G3 8HL](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Campanile+Glasgow+SECC-Hydro+Hotel/@55.859211,-4.2853997,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!3m8!1s0x4888467fd0455cad:0x440ff7f44b7cb167!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d55.859211!4d-4.283211!16s%2Fg%2F1tgc92nq?entry=ttu)

Hotel in the west end, close to the university and good access to public transport.  

Please take your luggage with you to SCENE and between hotels!
