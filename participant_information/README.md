## Travel

#### Flights:
You have received a pdf with your flight details via email. Our university travel provider, Selective, has booked your flights. Ensure you check in online for your flights using the provided airline reference number. If you have problems with boarding contact Selective asap (contact details on ticket).

#### Arrival in Glasgow: 
Your flight will arrive at [Glasgow International Airport](https://www.glasgowairport.com/). The easiest way to get to your hotel (Motel One, see below) is to get the [Glasgow Airport Express Service 500 bus](https://www.glasgowairport.com/to-and-from/bus/) from stance 1. Follow the link for info on tickets. Failing that you can get a taxi from the taxi rank.

## Accommodation

During the workshop (26-30th) you will stay on location at a university field station, SCENE (outside of Glasgow), in single or multiple occupancy rooms. Either side of the workshop (25th June & 1st July) we will provide hotel accommodation in Glasgow city. Due to high demand during the summer months (and an Arctic Monkeys gig!) we have had to split your stay into 2 hotels, therefore the itinerary is a bit complicated: 

#### 25-26th June: [Motel One Glasgow](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/glasgow/hotel-glasgow/) 
Address: 78-82 Oswald St, Glasgow G1 4PL [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Motel+One/@55.859211,-4.2853997,17z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x4888469c3b4faced:0xbbdada611fdf447!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d55.8583001!4d-4.2595688!16s%2Fg%2F11f4ppgx9m?entry=ttu)
When you arrive in Glasgow, travel from the airport to this hotel! Hotel in the city centre, great access to public transport (right next to Glasgow Central train station!)
#### 26-30th June: [SCENE](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/scene/)
University field station beside Loch Lomond. A beautiful location!
#### 1-2nd July: [Hotel Campanile Glasgow SECC](https://glasgow.campanile.com/en-us/)
Address: 10 Tunnel St, Glasgow G3 8HL [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Campanile+Glasgow+SECC-Hydro+Hotel/@55.859211,-4.2853997,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!3m8!1s0x4888467fd0455cad:0x440ff7f44b7cb167!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d55.859211!4d-4.283211!16s%2Fg%2F1tgc92nq?entry=ttu)
Hotel in the west end, close to the university and good access to public transport.

Please take your luggage with you to SCENE and between hotels!
