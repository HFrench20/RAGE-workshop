## Accommodation

During the workshop (26-30th) you will stay on location at a university field station, SCENE (outside of Glasgow), in single or multiple occupancy rooms. Either side of the workshop (25th June & 1st July) we will provide hotel accommodation in Glasgow city. Due to high demand during the summer months (and an Arctic Monkeys gig!) we have had to split your stay into 2 hotels, therefore the itinerary is a bit complicated: 

#### 25-26th June: [Motel One Glasgow](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/glasgow/hotel-glasgow/) Address: 78-82 Oswald St, Glasgow G1 4PL
Hotel in the city centre, great access to public transport (right next to Glasgow Central train station!)
#### 26-30th June: [SCENE](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/scene/)
University field station beside Loch Lomond. A beautiful location!
#### 1-2nd July: [Hotel Campanile Glasgow SECC](https://glasgow.campanile.com/en-us/)
Hotel in the west end, close to the university and good access to public transport.
